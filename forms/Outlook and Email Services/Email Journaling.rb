# There are three different types of journaling that you can enable in Exchange Server 2003.
# 
# Message-only journaling
# Message-only journaling captures all messages from users on a specific mailbox database and sends the message copy to a specified journaling mailbox.
# 
# BCC journaling
# BCC journaling is message-only journaling with a capture of BCC recipients. When BCC journaling is enabled, Exchange Server captures all recipients (TO / CC / BCC).
# 
# Note: 
# BCC journaling doesnâ€™t work if the recipient list contains hidden distribution lists, query-based distribution lists, or distribution lists that have another expansion server.
# 
# Envelope journaling
# Envelope journaling is different from message-only journaling and BCC journaling in that it allows you to archive P1 message headers (envelope headers). This includes information about the recipients, including BCC recipients and recipients from distribution groups.
